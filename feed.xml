                <p>In the home automation era, I was quite curious to understand how is working a simple thermal sensor</p>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>ESP8266</li>
<li>DHT22</li>
<li>usb power</li>
<li>Influxdb</li>
<li>Grafana</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried this simple experiment following the suggestion of one of my colleagues, i was thinking to start with Arduino , however he suggested to try nodemcu</p>
<p>So what is <em>nodemcu?<br></em>It's an open source platform developed for IoT , you can <em>compile</em> the firmware with the most used sensors available , but the main feature is the Lua support<br>When i starts with Arduino i created some C software really horrible 😇<br>with Lua instead it was quite simple create this kind of functionality.</p>
<p>The hardware platform is really nice and simple </p>
<h4>ESP8266</h4>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.39.16.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.39.16-xs.png 300w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.39.16-sm.png 480w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.39.16-md.png 768w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.39.16-lg.png 1024w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.39.16-xl.png 1360w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.39.16-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="640" height="565"></figure>
<p> </p>
<p>It's natively support wifi and with the sensor dht22 you are able to have the temperature, humidity ... and well also a dew point since is it a maths of previous values</p>
<h4>DHT22</h4>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.42.27.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.42.27-xs.png 300w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.42.27-sm.png 480w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.42.27-md.png 768w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.42.27-lg.png 1024w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.42.27-xl.png 1360w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.42.27-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="640" height="602"></figure>
<p> </p>
<p>Price for both is really cheaper (aliexpress)</p>
<p>esp8266    --&gt; 3$<br>dht22          --&gt; 1$</p>
<p>Once you receive the hardware you can start to work on it </p>
<p>With <a href="https://nodemcu-build.com/">https://nodemcu-build.com/</a> you can build the firmware that fit your needs (in the next screen what is needed to interact with the thermal sensor)</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.46.37.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.46.37-xs.png 300w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.46.37-sm.png 480w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.46.37-md.png 768w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.46.37-lg.png 1024w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.46.37-xl.png 1360w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/23/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-24-at-21.46.37-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="640" height="484"></figure>
<p> </p>
<p>To load the firmware you should need <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esptool">https://github.com/espressif/esptool</a></p>
<p>with a command like this<br><code>python esptool.py -b 115200 --port=/dev/cu.<wbr>wchusbserial1410 write_flash  -fm=dio -fs=32m 0x0000 <span class="il">nodemcu</span>-master-12-modules-<wbr>2016-01-09-18-51-26-float.bin</code></p>
<p>Now.... it's time to create the Lua script</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>This is working since 2016 so i think we can consider stable 😁</p>
<pre><code>local SSID = "name wifi"
local SSID_PASSWORD = "password wifi"
local DEVICE = "name device"
local temperature = 20.0

wifi.setmode(wifi.STATION)
wifi.sta.config(SSID,SSID_PASSWORD)
wifi.sta.autoconnect(1)

local HOST = "server database"
local URI = "/write?db=collectd"

function build_post_request(host, uri, data_table)

     local data = data_table.Data_type .. ",device=" .. data_table.Device .. " " .. "value=" .. data_table.Value

     --for param,value in pairs(data_table) do
    --      data = data .. param.."="..value.."&amp;"
    -- end
    print(data)

     request = "POST "..uri.." HTTP/1.1\r\n"..
     "Host: "..host.."\r\n"..
     "Connection: close\r\n"..
     "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n"..
     "Content-Length: "..string.len(data).."\r\n"..
     "\r\n"..
     data

     print(request)

     return request
end

local function display(sck,response)
     print(response)
end

-- When using send_sms: the "from" number HAS to be your twilio number.
-- If you have a free twilio account the "to" number HAS to be your twilio verified number.
-- The numbers MUST include the country code.
-- DO NOT add the "+" sign.
local function send_data(data_type,device,value)

     local data = {
      Data_type = data_type,
      Device = device,
      Value = value
     }

     socket = net.createConnection(net.TCP,0)
     socket:on("receive",display)
     socket:connect(8086,HOST)

     socket:on("connection",function(sck)

          local post_request = build_post_request(HOST,URI,data)
          sck:send(post_request)
     end)
end

function check_wifi()
 local ip = wifi.sta.getip()

 if(ip==nil) then
   print("Connecting...")
 else
  tmr.stop(0)
  print("Connected to AP!")
  print(ip)
  --send_data("15551234567","12223456789","Hello from your ESP8266")

  local t, h, d = getTempHumi()

  print("Temp:"..t .." C\n")
  print("Humi:"..h .." RH\n")
  print("Dew:"..d .." DP\n")

  send_data("temperature", DEVICE, t)
  send_data("humidity", DEVICE, h)
  send_data("dew_point", DEVICE, d)

  tmr.alarm(0,30000,1,check_wifi)

 end

end

tmr.alarm(0,5000,1,check_wifi)

function getTempHumi()
    pin = 4
    local status,temp,humi,temp_decimial,humi_decimial = dht.read(pin)
    if( status == dht.OK ) then
    -- Float firmware using this example
      print("DHT Temperature:"..temp..";".."Humidity:"..humi)
    elseif( status == dht.ERROR_CHECKSUM ) then
      print( "DHT Checksum error." );
    elseif( status == dht.ERROR_TIMEOUT ) then
      print( "DHT Time out." );
    end
    local dewpoint= (humi/100)^(1/8) * (112 + (0.9 * temp)) - 112 + (0.1 * temp)

    return temp, humi, (string.format("%.1f", dewpoint))
end</code></pre>
<h4>Customizations</h4>
<p>local SSID = "wifi name"  <br>local SSID_PASSWORD = "wifi password" <br>local DEVICE = "name device"        --&gt; name of you board/room </p>
<p>local HOST = "server database"     --&gt; your influxdb installation<br>local URI = "/write?db=collectd"     --&gt; your database name </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So we have the hardware , we loaded the firmware, we created the code, but how to interact with the platform... well there are many way however <a href="https://esp8266.ru/esplorer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPlorer</a> has a nice gui even if it's java based ☠️</p>

                <p>Contrary to popular belief, monitoring an infrastructure is the opposite to just have some metrics about applications and network</p>
<p>There are many many documents the lead this topic,<br>one of the most interesting it's just few pages from Google around <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/sre.google/it//static/pdf/art-of-slos-slides.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the art of slos</a><br>or the <a href="https://www.k8s.it/media/files/The Art of SLOs - Google.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">book</a> version i took from a google onsite deep dive. <a href="https://www.k8s.it/media/files/The Art of SLOs - Google.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<p>To better details this topic i'd like to use simple statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>WHAT</li>
<li>WHY</li>
<li>WHO</li>
<li>HOW</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHAT </h3>
<p>This is probably the main argument we will discuss on this thread </p>
<p>There no magic formulas or tools to use, if you expect to buy a tool that work with metrics out of the box, you're wrong. <br>Tools are the infrastructure to store and visualize data... but first of all you need to collect the right data.</p>
<p>What is the DATA you need ?<br>Those are you will record moving yourself on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">customer position</span></p>
<p><strong>Customer position</strong> : i'm using this term because i suppose you are not an onlus so you have a customer, but customer is a overall word with the meaning of all people are using your product:</p>
<ul>
<li>people that buy something e-commerce (Amazon, Bestbuy, Aliexpress)</li>
<li>people that use website to learn something (Cnn, Bloomberg, Wikipedia)</li>
<li>people that work on finance and use finance applications (Navision, SAP, JD Edwards)</li>
<li>people that use energy from nuclear site </li>
</ul>
<p>So moving yourself on the customer position you can better understand the definition of data that you need to know to better monitor your application with the righe <strong>customer metrics </strong></p>
<p>Stupid example ... imagine an automatic gate</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/Screenshot-2021-01-03-at-16.31.43.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-03-at-16.31.43-xs.png 300w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-03-at-16.31.43-sm.png 480w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-03-at-16.31.43-md.png 768w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-03-at-16.31.43-lg.png 1024w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-03-at-16.31.43-xl.png 1360w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-03-at-16.31.43-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1092" height="522"></figure>
<p>What is the definition of "it's working?"</p>
<ul>
<li>it opens</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously YES , but not only</p>
<ul>
<li>what about if it's not closing ? </li>
<li>what about if it opens in 10 minutes , it's acceptable ?</li>
<li>what about if after X times the automation is broken ? </li>
<li>etc etc ...</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can imagine we can define not only the objective values (open/close), we can elaborate customer subjective frustration , if i have to buy an automatic gate, i will not choose the one that will take 10 minutes to open... because... because 10 minutes are too much , based on subjective value as a customer.</p>
<p>In the same way we cannot say that our application is working because it's answers.</p>
<p>So <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what</span> we have to consider when we start to monitor an application in production?</p>
<p>Let's start with 3 macro clusters:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>system</strong> resources, so all metrics related to the pod (cpu,network,...)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>application</strong> standard metrics (thread, gc, errors per minute, requests per minute, ... )</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>business</strong> metrics that are inherent from the application scope, if the application provides a checkout for goods, we need to know for example how many transactions were fine and how many rejected</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>System</strong></h4>
<p>Those are the most easiest and used metrics since you started to monitor services.<br>On this group we have the basis metrics related to the system usage,<br>considering the evolution of the platform those values are day by day less influential than before.<br>This is because as soon we are increasing the technology level from bare metal, to vm , to docker to serverless ... the evaluation of those numbers could raise some mistake on the interpretation , however we still need to start with the basis in order to have data to define a trend based on specific situations</p>
<p>Here an example about the bare metal used as vsphere 6.7</p>

<p>always on the system metrics we can go more in deep checking a virtual machine inside this host, here the one i used to host my kubernetes lab</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-15.53.29.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-15.53.29-xs.png 300w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-15.53.29-sm.png 480w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-15.53.29-md.png 768w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-15.53.29-lg.png 1024w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-15.53.29-xl.png 1360w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-15.53.29-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1024" height="371"></figure>
<p>In the 2 images for example we can assume that we have something that move the cpu close to 100% cyclically (it's a <a href="https://www.k8s.it/kubernetes-sitespeedio.html">crawler</a> to perform check on website pages every hours)</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>Application</strong></h4>
<p>It's time now to move inside the kubernetes cluster and check how is going on the a web application inside the cluster<br>Since this application it is springboot based, we have the opportunity to understand how is going on from a framework side (java) and behavioural interactions.<br>Response time server to server, server errors, client errors, sql interactions, garbage collector, sidecars (is a pod with multiple images) usage, logs creation , metrics creation etc etc</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/app_metrics.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/app_metrics-xs.png 300w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/app_metrics-sm.png 480w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/app_metrics-md.png 768w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/app_metrics-lg.png 1024w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/app_metrics-xl.png 1360w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/app_metrics-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1024" height="956"></figure>
<p>Having those in place you can understand from an application point of view how is going on the performances release by release.. what happen in case of bugs and critical condition (unexpected huge traffic) , the area where you can put you effort on improvements.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Business</strong></span></h4>
<p>OK system is covered , application is covered ... what about the customer perception ?</p>
<p>This is the most critical topic , if your application is part of a microservices funnel or a monolithic application that manage the entire product, it's supposed that in some way you have benefits from its performances</p>
<p>So move yourself on the customer position monitoring your website from a customer point of view with business metrics , in this simple case i just monitor the cms page on top <br>It's a website:</p>
<ul>
<li>so how long does it take have the page ?</li>
<li>which are the most relevant data you need to know to improve?</li>
<li>do you have the same trends every time ?</li>
<li>etc etc</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h3>WHY</h3>
<p>With those cluster of metrics we can define and plan the architecture and the forecasting for the company ... remember that when something goes wrong with no metrics you will probably cascade to situation like this</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.41.07.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.41.07-xs.png 300w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.41.07-sm.png 480w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.41.07-md.png 768w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.41.07-lg.png 1024w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.41.07-xl.png 1360w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.41.07-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1024" height="441"></figure>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>System</strong> metrics can share the usages and the density of you infrastructure creating the basis <span style="text-decoration: underline;">alerts</span> in case of suffering but also plan the evolution of the platform itself  </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Application </strong>metrics share the framework behaviour and the evolution of your application day by day , <span style="text-decoration: underline;">alerts</span> are defined to monitor the scalability, bugs and application behaviour</span></p>
<p><strong>Business <span style="font-weight: 400;">metrics share the thresholds to use as alerts but not only... </span><br></strong>In this example we are talking about a web application <br>If you are selling something through it ,conversion is always the most relevant buzzword</p>
<p>From the 100 visitors , who will continue the navigation till the purchase, the remaining are really a small slice (e-commerce for example)</p>

<p>This images comes from an 2015 <a href="https://blogs.akamai.com/2015/07/conversion-impact-score-what-is-it-and-why-do-you-need-to-know-yours.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> from Akamai that is really still actual ...<br>Conversion is always impacted by page response time , more close you are in the first navigation phases like searching rather than checkout where you probably have more clear will to purchase<br><br>Now we know the data around the usage of our website and we can create <strong>GOALs</strong> and <strong>KPI</strong> to improve those values in order to better fit with the customer expectation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHO</h3>
<p>Those actors could be different case by case, from a small company to an enterprise, even if you are a full stack whateverops, a developer or part of monitoring team, in this scope you should not be alone. </p>
<p><strong>System</strong> and <strong>Application</strong> are usually managed by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sre/devops/sysadmin</span> with the help of architecture/developer to define the best framework metrics to monitor.</p>
<p>On the opposite side <strong>Business </strong>are more close with the product side, who will be better than the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">product dept</span> (developers) itself defining the kpi and goals used as a metrics with the cooperation of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">business dept</span> to define the <strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">thresholds.</span></strong></p>
<p>This cooperation will be useful to define:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right alerts to right people</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support granted by ownership</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No speculations, real data</span></li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>HOW</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<h4>Infrastructure</h4>
<p>First of all you have to define the monitoring/alerting platform, <br>the suggestion is to have this platform scalable with a good UI (grafana) to work with backend storage (prometheus + cortex/thanos, graphite + carbonzipper, influxdb, etc etc)</p>
<p>Honestly if you are in a big environment and you make a mistake in metrics configuration with graphite (push model) you can saturate the space since every time you create a new metric you are creating whisper file with the dimension based on the retention schema.<br>I prefer prometheus (pull model) that could prevent those issues and better fit the kubernetes standars , will be also more easy create a /metrics page on your application rather than use sidecar pods to stream metrics with collectd/telegraf/statsd and so on.</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Less is more</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many metrics are enough to create a valid alert?</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.48.07.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.48.07-xs.png 300w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.48.07-sm.png 480w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.48.07-md.png 768w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.48.07-lg.png 1024w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.48.07-xl.png 1360w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.48.07-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1024" height="764"></figure>
<p>The more metrics identify the service behaviour the more we can create a dedicated alert...<br>anyway  ....<br>The anti-pattern model currently applied in some cases: <br>have tons of metrics that generate only <strong>noise</strong> without identifying the healthiness of a service</p>
<p><em>Keep it simple</em> and define the structure of your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">System,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Application</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business</span> metrics .</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Smart metrics</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not only ONE value that show off the healthiness, but the combination of multiple metrics that guarantee the status</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.46.34.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.46.34-xs.png 300w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.46.34-sm.png 480w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.46.34-md.png 768w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.46.34-lg.png 1024w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.46.34-xl.png 1360w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-17.46.34-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1024" height="303"></figure>
<p>This concept is really important, imagine a dynamic infrastructure based on kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HPA</a> </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-18.22.01.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-18.22.01-xs.png 300w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-18.22.01-sm.png 480w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-18.22.01-md.png 768w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-18.22.01-lg.png 1024w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-18.22.01-xl.png 1360w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/20/responsive/Screenshot-2021-01-05-at-18.22.01-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1024" height="632"></figure>
<p>where you can probable have some value linear (like thread), mitigated by the horizontal autoscaling, you should combine multiple values to define the application status.</p>
<p>Create the metrics alert with <strong>trends</strong> not with the pure number <br>Ex. 70 threads value alone make no sense , different applications has different threads value , what is important is the <strong>delta , </strong>the percentage is useful to understand the behaviour, +50% threads make sense in all applications rather than the effective number.<br><br></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Be smart also on the evaluation with standard deviation and <strong>percentile</strong> ... mean is usually dropping the relevant value to evaluate performances under stress</p>

                <p>Great marketing quote, however i think we can better share a value that is always true... <br><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">keep it simple, keep it safe.</span></em></p>
<p>I would structure this article in few relevant topics</p>
<ul>
<li>Static website</li>
<li>Tools</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Monitor</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the above could be a specific topic that will fit others use cases</p>
<p><em>This is not a post about how to create a blog... this post will inspect into some technology that can simplify your life or your work with small but important concepts</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Static website</h3>
<p>Among the famous open cms i tried probably all of those,  during my career.<br>Basically are a web application with sql database in most of the cases.</p>
<p>Now we can discuss about the meaning of content generation , that should be dynamic and be part of the user experience rather than a page generated, however today i will talk just about the usage of a cms for a static(tbd) reality.</p>
<p>If your goal is promote your company, your hobbies, your work ... you have already heard about wordpress, joomla, drupal etc etc ... that are good (if not directly exposed) but had a huge problem... since are open and used by a relevant number of people, are subjected of vulnerability, moreover , if you install plugins the situation could be dramatic.</p>
<p>As much you install <strong>plugins</strong> (and really some cms are not able to do anything with a plugin),<br>as much your website is bloat.<br>With the same ratio the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">performances will decrease.</span></p>
<p>On top of this, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">huge</span> percentage of the plugins in the cms repository are old and out of date yet still available to install on your system.</p>
<p>So if you don't need something special (most of the blogs are wordpress only because it's easy to use) and you want to create a static website for your company, your business and so on , you can probably evaluate something different looking for , the first pillar mentioned, keep it simple.<br>Moreover the trend in a enterprise is moving from dynamic content to static as per the <strong>speed</strong> is the major KPI for a website</p>
<p>On a secondary binary in the last years the static cms are growth</p>

<li>Gatsby</li>
<li>Siteleaf</li>

<li>$whatever-js (every day we have a new js framework)</li>
<li>etc etc</li>
</ul>
<p>However if you are not so nerd ... or your are tremendously lazy (like me)<br>a grate alternative is <a href="https://getpublii.com/">Publii</a></p>
<p>Publii includes a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor for content creation,<br>really easy to use , and the client is available for multiple platform (win,linux,mac)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>I mentioned Publii before, this tool is just a simple way for lazy people to create a static website, i'll not go in deep with this software since is well explained in its website however offer multiple possibility where store the files , the main ones are s3 bucket and github pages.<br>Publii is not a pretty collaborative tool but is not supposed to have this kind of interaction on a static website, is more close to a human interaction only.<br><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">On the opposite side Jekyll and the other families are more close to be collaborative based on a git project and part of a pipeline flow (runner/actions)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Based on the backend for you html files, lets explore the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a><br>This service is free with few limits<br><em>Published GitHub Pages sites may be no larger than 1 GB.</em><br><em>GitHub Pages sites have a soft bandwidth limit of 100GB per month.</em><br><em>GitHub Pages sites have a soft limit of 10 builds per hour.</em></p>
<p>It's really easy to use and demand the security on the github account (always 2fa)<br>They offer a dns based on your github account and you can manage paths,<br>moreover you have the TLS/SSL for free</p>
<p>With Publii configuration is quite easy and you can follow the instruction <a href="https://getpublii.com/docs/host-static-website-github-pages.html">here</a> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another solution is use s3 as a repository, this require a bit more stuff sometimes, however even if it's a cheeper option, why not use an s3 on-prem if it's available <br>(this is just an excuse to use kubernetes, i still suggest to use the github pages, however i like to have this kind of exercise)</p>
<p>So welcome <a href="https://min.io/">minio</a> , a kubernetes object storage<br>The configuration is quite simple, as usual you can start with the namespace creation<br><code>kind: "Namespace"<br>apiVersion: "v1"<br>metadata:<br>  name: "minio"<br>  labels:<br>    name: "minio"</code></p>
<p>The service (this is just a single instance so no StatefulSets set is needed)<br><code>apiVersion: v1<br>kind: Service<br>metadata:<br>  name: minio-svc<br>  namespace: minio<br>  labels:<br>    app: minio<br>spec:<br>  ports:<br>  - port: 9000<br>    protocol: TCP<br>  selector:<br>    app: minio</code></p>
<p>PersistentVolumeClaim (from microk8s host provisioner)<br><code>apiVersion: v1<br>kind: PersistentVolumeClaim<br>metadata:<br>  namespace: minio<br>  name: minio-pv-claim<br>  labels:<br>    app: minio-storage-claim<br>spec:<br>  storageClassName: microk8s-hostpath<br>  accessModes:<br>    - ReadWriteOnce<br>  resources:<br>    requests:<br>      storage: 1Gi</code></p>
<p>Deployment (remember to use secrets instead write directly into deployment)<br><code>kind: Deployment<br>metadata:<br>  name: minio-deployment<br>  namespace: minio<br>spec:<br>  selector:<br>    matchLabels:<br>      app: minio<br>  strategy:<br>    type: Recreate<br>  template:<br>    metadata:<br>      labels:<br>        app: minio<br>    spec:<br>      volumes:<br>      - name: storage<br>        persistentVolumeClaim:<br>          claimName: minio-pv-claim<br>      containers:<br>      - name: minio<br>        image: minio/minio:latest<br>        args:<br>        - server<br>        - /storage<br>        env:<br>        - name: MINIO_ACCESS_KEY<br>          value: "$something"<br>        - name: MINIO_SECRET_KEY<br>          value: "$somethingsecret"<br>        - name: MINIO_DOMAIN<br>          value: minio.h4x0r3d.lan<br>        ports:<br>        - containerPort: 9000<br>          hostPort: 9000<br>        volumeMounts:<br>        - name: storage<br>          mountPath: "/storage"</code></p>
<p>Ingress resource<br><code>kind: Ingress<br>metadata:<br>  name: minio-ingress<br>  namespace: minio<br>  annotations:<br>    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx<br>    nginx.org/client-max-body-size: 1000m<br>    ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 1000m<br>spec:<br>  rules:<br>  - host: minio.h4x0r3d.lan<br>    http:<br>      paths:<br>      - path: /<br>        backend:<br>          serviceName: minio-svc<br>          servicePort: 9000</code></p>
<p>And at the end you will have something like this</p>

<p>you can configure Publii in this way</p>
<p>where bucket is the third level name of you dns and prefix "the bucket"</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/18/Screenshot-2020-12-26-at-13.56.43.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/18/responsive/Screenshot-2020-12-26-at-13.56.43-xs.png 300w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/18/responsive/Screenshot-2020-12-26-at-13.56.43-sm.png 480w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/18/responsive/Screenshot-2020-12-26-at-13.56.43-md.png 768w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/18/responsive/Screenshot-2020-12-26-at-13.56.43-lg.png 1024w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/18/responsive/Screenshot-2020-12-26-at-13.56.43-xl.png 1360w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/18/responsive/Screenshot-2020-12-26-at-13.56.43-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1024" height="811"></figure>
<p>Btw an object storage is <strong>NOT</strong> a web server so you need an apache or nginx configuration<br>to have the site ready to be used<br><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;<br>    ServerAdmin l@k8s.it<br>    DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/<br>    ServerName www.k8s.it<br>    ErrorLog logs/www.k8s-error_log<br>    CustomLog logs/www.k8s-access_log combined<br>    LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so<br>    ProxyRequests Off<br>    ProxyPass / http://minio-svc.minio.svc.cluster.local:9000/blog/<br>    RewriteEngine on<br>    RewriteRule ^(.*)/$ /$1/index.html [PT,L]<br> &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Again ... <strong>keep it simple</strong>... there no right solutions overall , there is the right way for you needs, in my case i'm still using github pages because are free, enough to cover my needs and <em>serverless</em></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Even if the security is demanded to github, why not extend a sort of protection on top of it</p>
<p>Second pillar , <strong>keep it safe</strong></p>
<p>In my case i really appreciate Cloudflare and the free plan that give me the possibility to test and explore the functionality offered</p>
<p>I've already shared how to configure a website with Cloudflare with terraform <a href="https://www.k8s.it/terraform-your-free-claudflare-account.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.k8s.it/terraform-your-free-claudflare-account.html</a></p>
<p>Even if we are covered by attacks since it's static webpage ... and we also added the Cloudflare protection we can have some <em>cosmetics</em> feature that will share a better compliance with the security in 2020</p>
<p>As i said github pages and s3 are not webserver so ... <br>how we can introduce the security headers ?</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/18/screencapture-securityheaders-2020-12-24-20_33_23.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/18/responsive/screencapture-securityheaders-2020-12-24-20_33_23-xs.png 300w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/18/responsive/screencapture-securityheaders-2020-12-24-20_33_23-sm.png 480w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/18/responsive/screencapture-securityheaders-2020-12-24-20_33_23-md.png 768w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/18/responsive/screencapture-securityheaders-2020-12-24-20_33_23-lg.png 1024w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/18/responsive/screencapture-securityheaders-2020-12-24-20_33_23-xl.png 1360w ,https://www.k8s.it/media/posts/18/responsive/screencapture-securityheaders-2020-12-24-20_33_23-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1024" height="1758"></figure>
<p> </p>
<p>Again Cloudflare help us with the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-unleashed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workers</a> feature</p>

<p>The code (<a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/security-headers-cloudflare-worker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rif</a>.) is adding those headers with serverless function  for each request</p>
<p><code>const securityHeaders = {<br>        "Content-Security-Policy": "upgrade-insecure-requests",<br>        "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=3600",<br>        "X-Xss-Protection": "1; mode=block",<br>        "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",<br>        "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",<br>        "Permissions-Policy": "geolocation=()",<br>        "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"<br>    };<br><br><br>async function addHeaders(req) {<br>    const response = await fetch(req),<br>        newHeaders = new Headers(response.headers),<br>        setHeaders = Object.assign({}, securityHeaders);<br><br>    if (newHeaders.has("Content-Type") &amp;&amp; !newHeaders.get("Content-Type").includes("text/html")) {<br>        return new Response(response.body, {<br>            status: response.status,<br>            statusText: response.statusText,<br>            headers: newHeaders<br>        });<br>    }<br><br>    Object.keys(setHeaders).forEach(name =&gt; newHeaders.set(name, setHeaders[name]));<br><br><br>    return new Response(response.body, {<br>        status: response.status,<br>        statusText: response.statusText,<br>        headers: newHeaders<br>    });<br>}<br><br>addEventListener("fetch", event =&gt; event.respondWith(addHeaders(event.request)));</code></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now the website is better from this point of view, adding the worker to the main route</p>

<p>Just a warning because Strict-Transport-Security has a low value , but it's something acceptable to me</p>

<ul>
<li>website is managed with no database</li>
<li>we have serverless way to host it and with free options</li>
<li>overall protection from Cloudflare</li>
<li>security headers from Cloudflare workers, again another serveless option</li>

<p>Nothing relevant in my case... but useful to know</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Is now time to know , how is performing the website to do this i already had a deepdive about website usability</p>

<p>but again we have some other feature serverless style like <a href="https://github.com/upptime/upptime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upptime</a> ,with github actions you can create a monitoring system like this <a href="https://lorenzogirardi.github.io/status/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://lorenzogirardi.github.io/status/</a></p>

<p>Another alternative is <a href="https://hetrixtools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hetrixtools</a> , free up top 15 probes that give you the possibility to monitor your websites and smtp, and have an alerting system out of the box with a telegram bot email and sms (up to 50)</p>

<p>Hope this post cover how the technology could be used as much as possible in a small and cheap scenario to reflect some hints to an enterprise scenario.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Well ... <strong>NO!</strong></p>
<p>Ok maybe are missing some context</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I started this topic looking around the data center world compared with the cloud providers,<br>the advantage of manage services , the mindset infrastructure as a code and so on ...</p>
<p>In the last 4y we saw a kubernetes rush , a lot of company are sharing the advantages and the perfect picture create into kubernetes, how they save money or scale fast ... but is always true what we see?<br>Most of the times we are saw only builded success case.</p>
<p>Today we will take in consideration those topics :</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual machines</li>
<li>Data center</li>
<li>Kubernetes</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that the Data center topic should be covered more in deep, maybe talking about the entire ecosystem (db, vertical services , corporate usage , LEGACY!!!!) however today i'd like to explore only the kubernetes and virtualization rather than lose the discussion in thousand of concepts.</p>
<h3>Long story short</h3>
<p>A long time ago Borg was born in Google .. now formally named kubernetes,<br>in the first period the main evaluation was:<br>"<em>why the virtualization overhead if we will use kubernetes</em>".<br><br>This concept was justified in some way for <em>overlapping</em> of duties,<br>if i migrate a vm as a kubernetes pod this means i can remove the vm <br><br></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center">                      <img loading="lazy"  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ethzero/image/upload/v1607974463/misc/vm_vs_pod.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="" width="337" height="181"></figure>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We can imagine a picture like this looking back of some years ago</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ethzero/image/upload/v1607963386/misc/vm_1.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="" width="745" height="386"></figure>
<figure class="post__image">The introduction was good , almost all declared this could be a new way.<br>Moving faster, all companies changed a bit this picture with an expansion of kubernetes </figure>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ethzero/image/upload/v1607963386/misc/vm_2.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="" width="745" height="386"></figure><figure class="is-loaded"><img loading="lazy"  src="Kubernetes destroyed the virtualization... or NOT - LAB_files/vm_2.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="" width="745" height="386" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Like an infection (good this time, not the 20covid ones) kubernetes come as a main platform for most of the online company...<br>In a datacenter , you know, there no something eternal:</p>
<ul>
<li>hardware in EOL</li>
<li>generation refresh</li>
<li>brand change</li>
<li>good is ok but cheaper is better (usually from finance)</li>
</ul>
<p>Is also true , that sometimes this encouraged a forced/incorrect usage of kubernetes node labeling in order to bend the infrastructure to better fit the products migrated or the existing hardware availability</p>

<h3>Houston we have a problem...</h3>
<p>Working in this way, the environment could be fragmented ,<br>even if the technology is the same there are some logical segmentations that create some problems in the day by day activities.</p>
<ul>
<li>isolate some workloads with labels can create an hw lock-in (better approach a multi-cluster with unique controlplane)</li>
<li>updates require to be managed in a different way looking for the label/role</li>
<li>please do not touch the storage nodes now (fiber channel with external storage)</li>
<li>please do not touch the storage nodes tomorrow (fiber channel with external storage)</li>
<li>omg we lost a storage nodes (fiber channel with external storage)</li>
<li>and so on ...</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover an hardware fault could create problems .... <br>YES i know in a infrastructure as a code , with puppet foreman chef salt ansible terraform etc, this will be recovered fast ... but this is not always true ... you know... some machines/roles in a mid/ent company are still fragile.</p>
<ul>
<li>legacy with no ownership</li>
<li>legacy with wrong ownership</li>
<li>single point of failure ... (yes also in 2020)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Other problems are related with new hardware...</p>
<ul>
<li>is the provisioning working as expected with new generations ?</li>
<li>and if we change the hardware vendor ?</li>
<li>etc etc when you have to handle new preseed/ks because the layout is changed ☠️</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Last but not least ... what about the bare metal density ?</p>
<p><code>Allocated resources:</code><br><code> (<span class="il">Total</span> <span class="il">limits</span> <span class="il">may</span> be <span class="il">over</span> <span class="il">100</span> <span class="il">percent</span>, i.e., <span class="il">overcommitted</span>.</code><br><code> CPU Requests CPU <span class="il">Limits</span> Memory Requests Memory <span class="il">Limits</span></code><br><code> ------------ ---------- --------------- -------------</code><br><code> 55 (98%) 101300m (180%) 86376Mi (44%) 121672Mi (62%)</code></p>
<p>This HW has 56 core with HT , we reached the 98% but this number is high <br>because some pods needs a default cpu just to fit the nodes and start, while the running cost is really low. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>So why not kubernetes hosted in virtual machines ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Having an abstraction layer, is quite simple tune the provisioning based on this , rather than the bare metal, it's just a metter of roles not to the entire provisioning.</li>
<li>Hardware fault could be easily covered by live migration</li>
<li>Maintenance and update can be manage creating a blue green approach and rolling updates</li>
<li>Density could be increased with mode nodes in the same hw</li>
<li>Flexibility to scale up and to upset a new datacenter in case of migration will be higher</li>
<li>Team at the and is also able to scale , working from the vmware and not from bare metal</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ethzero/image/upload/v1607961166/misc/team_scale.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="" width="718" height="353"></figure></figure>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Virtualization and kubernetes are not antagonist, must be in addition , the first one has just change the scope to better cooperate with kubernetes</p>
<p>Instead a layer for microservices , virtualization is now the layer that guarantee an homogeneous platform were a team can work on top to create the infrastructure having the advantage of a fully consolidated technology that is able to promote the right abstraction </p>
<p>Last but not least , we don't need to reinvent something , we can just copy from the major competitors for the kubernetes topic<br>How is working GKE , AKS , EKS ? .... virtual machines :)</p>

                <p>It's time to talk about the api gateway</p>
<p>In a modern infrastructure , especially in a microservices environment you probably know what i'm referring to ,however it's better to clarify some points.</p>
<p><em>An API gateway takes all API calls from clients, then routes them to the appropriate microservice with request routing, composition, and protocol translation. Typically it handles a request by invoking multiple microservices and aggregating the results, to determine the best path. It can translate between web protocols and web‑unfriendly protocols that are used internally.</em></p>
<p><em>An e‑commerce site might use an API gateway to provide mobile clients with an endpoint for retrieving all product details with a single request. It invokes various services, like product info and reviews, and combines the results</em></p>

<p>Some months ago i discussed about the service mesh<br><a href="https://github.com/lorenzogirardi/kubernetes-servicemesh">https://github.com/lorenzogirardi/kubernetes-servicemesh</a></p>
<p>To better understand the differences on those products it is better to summarize the common areas</p>

<p>Around the api gateway world we have some possibility, some of those are onprem, some other in cloud or hybrid.</p>
<p>The onprem scenario we have some historycal software and a "new generation" born in a kubernetes architecture, howevere here we will check for a tool that could work in kubernetes (with a plus for supporting vm)</p>
<p>From the most knew i'd like to mention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kong</li>
<li>Tyk</li>
<li>Nginx</li>
<li>Ambassador</li>
<li>3scale</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other side on the cloud scenario we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aws api gateway</li>
<li>Mashery (from Tibco)</li>
<li>Google apigee</li>
<li>Akana (hybrid)</li>
<li>Azure api management</li>
</ul>

<p>The advantage/disadvantage of cloud solution is the pay per use, you don't need to manage the infrastrcture but only the configuration and you have the support that can drive you on the right configuration.<br>Another valid point of view is the <em>DDOS</em> attack that will not land to your platform but to a cloud infrastructure that is supposed was designed to manage this scenario.</p>

<p>Those solutions should be hosted on your platform or in a cloud to let the datacenter <em>unknown</em> (anyway you have to pay per traffic "*" ).<br>Your engineer team need to know how it's working the infrastructure but they can also improve the process with automations</p>
<p>PRO:</p>
<ul>
<li>open source</li>
<li>customizable</li>
<li>awareness on the complete funnel</li>
</ul>
<p>CONS:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have to take care about attacks</li>
<li>infrastructure knowhow</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br>"*" you can easly have the apigw hosted onprem combined with a cdn/waf with ip lockdown , however you still have to pay the traffic towards it.</p>

<p>Let's start to work...<br>I've used the public kong deployment with some changes to have the database where store the configurations.</p>
<p>Another trick is create it as a secondary <em>ingress</em> , since i've already and ingress in my infrastructure , kong is done to answer on different ports</p>
<p>All the yaml are subdivided per role</p>
<pre><code>kong
|-- 01-kong-ns.yaml
|-- 02-kong-cr.yaml
|-- 03-kong-sa.yaml

|-- 06-kong-svc.yaml
|-- 07-kong-dpl.yaml
|-- 08-kong-ss.yaml
`-- 09-kong-job.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>some differences are related to the services node ports, deployment binding host and the database is now hosted with a volumeClaimTemplates</p>

<p>Now i'd like to have also an Admin UI, i'm not fan of web ui ,<br>however i need to know if this interface could be shared outside IT<br>to delegate some business ownership and so on.</p>
<p>Kong Enterprise has it's own web ui instead the community one needs a third party tool... <a href="https://github.com/pantsel/konga">Konga</a></p>
<p>In the same way of kong, konga needs a database , and in the same way i elaborated a bit the default deployment</p>
<pre><code>konga
|-- 01-ns-konga.yaml
|-- 02-svc-konga.yaml
|-- 03-ing-konga.yaml
`-- 04-dpl-konga.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>just a couple of TIPS</p>
<p>postgres persistent storage</p>
<pre><code>apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  namespace: konga
  name: konga-pv-claim
  labels:
    app: konga-storage-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: microk8s-hostpath
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 200Mi
</code></pre>
<p>and on deployment ...</p>
<pre><code>        env:
        - name: NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED
          value: "0"
        - name: NODE_ENV
          value: "production"
</code></pre>
<p>where NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED is the option to not verify the kong api certificate and</p>
<p><br>NODE_ENV is way to enable production or development , if you are not using production, the other two option enables the debug model and increase the cpu usage, i suggest to use production anyway <strong>during the first deploy you should enable development in order to bootstrap the sql schema</strong> that production is not able to do ... or create an init container to deploy the schema</p>

<li>kong [INSTALLED]</li>
<li>konga [INSTALLED]</li>
<li>backend [INSTALLED]</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all we need to expose the backend with Kong in this example i created an ingress configuration dedicated for this porpose</p>
<pre><code>apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "kong"
  name: api
  namespace: pytbak
  labels:
    app: api
spec:
  rules:
    - host: api.ing.h4x0r3d.lan
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /api/
            backend:
              serviceName: pytbak-svc
              servicePort: 5000
          - path: /api/get/
            backend:
              serviceName: pytbak-svc
              servicePort: 5000
          - path: /api/post/
            backend:
              serviceName: pytbak-svc
              servicePort: 5000
          - path: /api/put/
            backend:
              serviceName: pytbak-svc
              servicePort: 5000
          - path: /api/delete/
            backend:
              serviceName: pytbak-svc
              servicePort: 5000
</code></pre>
<p><code>kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "kong" </code>to match the kong ingress on the backend application <code>namespace: pytbak</code>.<br>As you can see i created mutiple paths to simulate different applications behind and create different ruls per path/application/context.</p>
<p>The kong configuration could be applied with</p>
<ul>
<li>kubernetes yaml</li>
<li>kong api</li>
<li>konga ui (only if you have the database)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the repo you will see some in kubernetes and some other not present , i tested the three option and the <strong>kong api</strong> is the best one</p>

<p>A plugin will always be run once and only once per request. But the configuration with which it will run depends on the entities it has been configured for.</p>
<p>Plugins can be configured for various entities, combination of entities, or even globally. This is useful, for example, when you wish to configure a plugin a certain way for most requests, but make authenticated requests behave slightly differently.</p>
<p>Therefore, there exists an order of precedence for running a plugin when it has been applied to different entities with different configurations. The rule of thumb is: the more specific a plugin is with regards to how many entities it has been configured on, the higher its priority.</p>
<p>The complete order of precedence when a plugin has been configured multiple times is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plugins configured on a combination of: a Route, a Service, and a Consumer. (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).</li>
<li>Plugins configured on a combination of a Route and a Consumer. (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).</li>
<li>Plugins configured on a combination of a Service and a Consumer. (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).</li>
<li>Plugins configured on a combination of a Route and a Service.</li>
<li>Plugins configured on a Consumer. (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).</li>
<li>Plugins configured on a Route.</li>
<li>Plugins configured on a Service.</li>
<li>Plugins configured to run globally.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: if the rate-limiting plugin is applied twice (with different configurations): for a Service (Plugin config A), and for a Consumer (Plugin config B), then requests authenticating this Consumer will run Plugin config B and ignore A. However, requests that do not authenticate this Consumer will fallback to running Plugin config A. Note that if config B is disabled (its enabled flag is set to false), config A will apply to requests that would have otherwise matched config B.</p>

<p>Kong is a scalable, open source API Gateway.<br>Kong runs in front of any RESTful API and is extended through Plugins, which provide extra functionality and services beyond the core platform.</p>
<p>The architecture is quite simple to understand and is made up of a few components…</p>
<ul>
<li>Kong base-module which wraps OpenResty and Nginx and is the engine which does the actual work</li>
<li>Database layer with choice of Cassandra or Postgres to store all the configuration so it can be retrieved easily in case of failures</li>
<li>Dashboard which provides User-Interface for API administration and viewing analytics (embedded in th Enerprise, third party for the community <em>Konga</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Powerful of Kong is also supported by plugins from authentication, security, traffic control, logging, and etc…<br><br></p>

<p>The application is working with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE<br>enouth to cover most of the usages based on rest api.</p>
<p>Inside the docker path you can run easly as local docker</p>
<p><code>docker build --tag pytbak:0.1 .</code><br><code>docker run -t -p 5000:5000 pytbak:0.1</code><br>and access on it with <code>locahost:5000/api/</code></p>
<p>instead if you want to run it in kubernetes ,<br>starting from the main folder you can apply the kubernetes folder on your environment<br><code>kubectl apply -f kubernetes/</code></p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl  get pods -n pytbak
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pytbak-stable-5dfb4fbfd4-n64kx   1/1     Running   0          40m
</code></pre>
<p>Remember to change the host in the ingress file configuration</p>
<pre><code>$ cat 03-ing-pytbak.yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: pytbak-ingress
  namespace: pytbak
  annotations:
    ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-connect-timeout: "10"
    ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "30"
    ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout: "30"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: pytbak.ing.h4x0r3d.lan
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: pytbak-svc
          servicePort: 5000
</code></pre>
<p><em>host: pytbak.ing.h4x0r3d.lan</em> this is my ingress dns resolution</p>
<p>TIPS: for ingress endpoints you can manage multiple namespace creating an A record in your DNS (as a subdomain) with a wildcard dedicated only for ingress matching the namespace and the host created</p>
<p>in my case i have the home dns as <code>h4x0r3d.lan</code><br>and <code>*.ing.h4x0r3d.lan</code> as a record A of my kubernetes ingress<br>in this way if i create a namespace <em>pippo</em> the dns that i have to call to reach it out will be <em>pippo.ing.4x0r3d.lan</em> with no change on DNS.<br><br><br><br></p>

<p>First of all, this is a thought around a website metrics management, is not the only way, but is one way for a high level overview.</p>
<p>How to read this ...</p>
<ul>
<li>i'm focused to share some concept about website monitoring</li>
<li>i'm sharing a possible way to manage in kubernetes</li>
<li>i'm using some other tools in kubernetes just because i'm evaluating this for other purpose</li>

<p>However you can reach the GOAL just using docker and crontab for example<br><br><br><br></p>

<p>Well ... a website is a product itself,<br>it could be a Wordpress, a Magento ecommerce or a structured multiple applications that owns each ones a different section of the website.</p>
<p>However if running a business on top, you should move your evolution as a customer perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>how long does is take the website asnwer ?</li>
<li>is the response time common for all sections ?</li>
<li>new versions/deployments are better than before for the customer ?</li>
</ul>
<p>You know, if the response time is more than X seconds ... and you are selling a common gadgets that could be retrieved elsewhere , you are losing money and customer affiliation.</p>
<p>There are also some others problems... when someone in your company or a customer will say ... the website il slow</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster from my fiber home connection</li>
<li>Faster from my mobile premium plus SIM</li>
<li>Slow from wireless</li>
<li>Fast from wireless</li>
<li>No idea</li>
<li>Faster than … ?!?! compared to ... ?!?!</li>
</ul>
<p>No, look how it's slow (2g connection in the sahara desert)<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3251fd1e9ec686be58b3f6c8669b185187843283/68747470733a2f2f7265732e636c6f7564696e6172792e636f6d2f6574687a65726f2f696d6167652f75706c6f61642f635f7363616c652c775f3238362f76313630313533343536332f6d6973632f53637265656e73686f745f323032302d31302d30315f61745f30382e34302e30362e706e67"><img loading="lazy" title="reaction" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3251fd1e9ec686be58b3f6c8669b185187843283/68747470733a2f2f7265732e636c6f7564696e6172792e636f6d2f6574687a65726f2f696d6167652f75706c6f61642f635f7363616c652c775f3238362f76313630313533343536332f6d6973632f53637265656e73686f745f323032302d31302d30315f61745f30382e34302e30362e706e67" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="reaction" data-canonical-src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ethzero/image/upload/c_scale,w_286/v1601534563/misc/Screenshot_2020-10-01_at_08.40.06.png"></a><br><br><br></p>

<ul>
<li>release by release</li>
<li>feature by feature</li>
<li>etc etc</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all we have to test our websites on the customer position... so no 1gbit inline connection with 0.00001 roundtrip :)</p>
<p>From the multitude of products , webtest , lighthouse , selenium and so on i really like sitespeed.io<br><br><br></p>

<p>You have to know your product and your customer ...</p>
<p>If you own the product you know that the customer is "forced" to buy by you. Immgine to are Apple, you know that customers are affiliated to you... so if something is slow, probably even if the device is available in other websites the customer will wait the answer.</p>
<p>On the opposite side if you are a retailer , and the product is quite common with no brandlove etc etc ... if the website is slow the user will change immediatly the website to land to somewhere else.<br><br></p>

<p>we usually define a <em>slowness</em> by a perception.</p>
<p>However , in 2020 you know the Data that comes from GA and understand when people leave a page , after some amount of time.</p>
<p>Consider those, rate and the timing to tune the threadshold</p>
<ul>
<li>Bounce</li>
<li>Leave/Exit</li>
</ul>
<p>and <ins>create the awareness</ins> about the limits and improvements you can achieve.</p>
<p>Example. If a search take more than 10seconds, say <em>ciao ciao</em> to the customer.</p>
<p>As said, when you mesure the speed you have to move yourself in the customer side ... so not all people has 1gbit connection , maybe the major are using mobile , maybe your host is in US and the customer in KR.<br>So ... internet connection should reflect the avg/wrost scenario Believe me that those data <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/global-index" rel="nofollow">https://www.speedtest.net/global-index</a> are quite optimistic :) i appreciate instead the documentation of sitespeed that has classified 4 networks</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/connectivity/" rel="nofollow">https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/connectivity/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>3g</li>
<li>3gfast</li>
<li>3gslow</li>
<li>cable</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd like to say that in 2020 <em>cable</em> and <em>3gfast</em> cover perfectly the wrost scenario</p>
<p>Even if you don't agree with the speed category, remember to look the graphs and the metrics considering the DELTA<br><br><br><br></p>

<p>This tool is open source , has a huge extension , in this scenario<br>i'll use only parts of that since i don't need the video recording, or HAR files and so on.</p>
<p>A full report could be useful to check all feature and you can find here<br><a href="https://lorenzogirardi.github.io/sitespeedio-results/" rel="nofollow">https://lorenzogirardi.github.io/sitespeedio-results/</a></p>

<p>and you can have those results only with using the docker image</p>
<p><code>docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/sitespeed.io" sitespeedio/sitespeed.io:15.2.0 https://www.k8s.it/</code></p>
<p>is know easy understand that you can extend in crontab this code and add some other option to store metrics and results files in s3 for example</p>

<p>Since we have identified the tool i have to specify the use case</p>
<ul>
<li>I need only metrics in this example because, so i don't need to store the output artifact</li>
<li>I want to store the metrics in influxdb</li>
<li>I want to run it not as a docker but inside kubernetes</li>
<li>TBD i'd like to orchestrate actions</li>
</ul>
<p>The sitespeed.io docker fit perfectly in a kubernetes cronjob vision<br><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/" rel="nofollow">https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/</a><br>is done to start, execute an action and exit</p>
<p>However i'd like to explore a workflow manager ... not just for this case but also to exend some other <em>jobs</em><br><br><br></p>

<p>I chose this product because i was interested to have something similar to Rundeck , but with more extended capability in order to be possible build a ci/cd without spinnaker<br><a href="https://argoproj.github.io/" rel="nofollow">https://argoproj.github.io/</a></p>
<p>The installation is quite easy , i've just trick a configmap due to volume mount problem genereted by my small kubernetes installation</p>
<p>For a basic installation you need to create a dedicated namespace<br><code>kubectl create namespace argo</code></p>
<p>and than deploy the argo infrastructure (server and workflow)<br><code>kubectl apply -n argo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo/stable/manifests/install.yaml</code></p>
<pre><code>NAMESPACE      NAME                                       READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
argo           argo-server-6c886c5b77-l8jfv               1/1     Running     1          2d13h
argo           workflow-controller-65948977d-zc9vt        1/1     Running     0          2d14h
</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned before i discover a <em>bug</em> (just because i use containerd instead docker in microk8s) , running the firt job<br><code>MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "docker-lib" : hostPath type check failed: /var/lib/docker is not a directory</code><br>However adding</p>
<pre><code>data:
  config: |
    containerRuntimeExecutor: pns
</code></pre>
<p>in <code>workflow-controller-configmap</code></p>
<p>i fixed the issue.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Well now Argo is running and you can interact with the web UI or creating a services and a ingress configuration or with the port forwarding.<br>Since i'm now experimenting the solution i'm just using the second option.</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl -n argo port-forward deployment/argo-server 2746:2746
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:2746 -&gt; 2746
Forwarding from [::1]:2746 -&gt; 2746
</code></pre>
<p>The UI interface is pretty clean and the authentication model follow the RBAC policy</p>

<p>Sitespeed is really good to have an high level view but also details that probably could save load time.</p>
<p>The introduction of Argo can orchestrate multiple checks on all pages/application you need to monitor without a specific crontab time for each job but considering a producer/consumer workflow.</p>

<p>Long story short my vps provider changed tha ammount for the small instance from 1$ to 3$<br>so i took the advantage to switch my postfix service from cloud to onprem.</p>
<p>Why, since the world is moving to cloud ?<br>Because my own domain is used just for alerting and small other stuff and 3$ month is creazy :)<br>Anyway i'll lost some good stuff like static ip and possibility ti have a ptr dns.<br>Shit happens it's just for my stuff.</p>
<p>However we have 3 different topics to describe in this project</p>
<ul>
<li>what is an email</li>
<li>postfix configuration</li>
<li>postfix in kubernetes</li>
</ul>

<p>send email sometimes is a dedicated work in an enterprise company.<br>There are many aspect to consider , not only infrastructure , like che segmentation of domains strategy,<br>email answer engagement and each isp is using a different threashold to mark your email as a spam,<br>however now we will focus only on the generic configuration with some minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Here some topic that you probably know:</p>
<ul>
<li>TLS (add an encrypted connection in delivery)</li>
<li>Sender-Id (mostly used for microsoft ecosystem)</li>
<li>PTR record (used to check the corrispondence of a real smtp)</li>
<li>SPF record (used on TXT level to define an whitelist of "smtp allowed to ...")</li>
<li>Dkim (a private and public certificate to match the smtp and emails)</li>
<li>Dmarc (a mix with SPF and Dkim to protect the domain from unauthorized use )</li>
</ul>

<p>The second one is more related to middleware behaviour<br>i have a domain "example.com" and i'd like to</p>
<ul>
<li>receive email from and to this domain</li>
<li>have catchall system to do not configure any email account but using everything <a href="mailto:a@example.com">a@example.com</a>, <a href="mailto:b@example.com">b@example.com</a>, <a href="mailto:whatever@example.com">whatever@example.com</a></li>
<li>relay all the emails to my gmail account</li>
<li>reject the email that are tried to sent outside my chosed domains</li>
</ul>
<p>For all those topics the main configuration is in virtual and transport map in <em>postfix</em><br>There are some articles in internet, i'll avoid to reinvent hot water with the explanation.</p>

<p><strong>Remember to ADD your right values inside secrets and configmap where you have CAPS like <code>YOUR_DOMAIN</code></strong></p>
<p>running the <em>apply</em> on kubernetes folder you will have the pod running<br><code>postfix postfix-7d664f786c-rmf54 1/1 Running 0 29m</code></p>

                <h2>Do we need a service mesh ?</h2>
<p>few years ago i started to evaluate this feature fitting in an existing infrastructure</p>
<p>There are many concept to consider and many mistake the people usually think<br>Better to start with what is <em>NOT</em> a work for a service mesh</p>
<ul>
<li>is not an apigw (even if could share some components)</li>
<li>is not the place to put firewall rules</li>
<li>is not something magic that boost the applications</li>
<li>is something that if not used with a know scope could generate a mess</li>
</ul>
<p>So what is ...<br>well short answer</p>
<ul>
<li>is the missing link in the infrastructure observability</li>
<li>is a way to handle in a structured way the application routing</li>
<li>is an internal ratelimit / anti ddos / infrastructure layer (be careful)</li>
<li>could be a clever way to improve some application limits (expanded next)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway is this something that we can add in our infrastructure ?</p>
<p>There no YES/NO , however we can evaluate the company and the maturity of microservices<br>internal rate limit , is usually a feature that could safe the infrastructure during snowball effects<br>however means that if the infrastructure is SYNC (no decoupling) have the rate limit can just<br>stop the application to serve requests , and this will propagated to the others below.</p>
<p>result: no answer<br>threads safe</p>
<p>Sometimes it's better to have a strategic business login using the a circuit breaker that bring a huge complexity in configuration.</p>
<p>The other point related to rate limit is .. who will maintain those values ?<br>Should be part of deployment pipeline and directly correlated with the application scope<br>In a 200+ micro services infrastructure this could be a huge problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>project that lost ownership</li>
<li>projects not well maintained</li>
<li>new legacy projects</li>
</ul>
<p>So my idea about rate limit is to use it in a specific "strategic" applications and should not indiscriminately added to the whole infrastructure</p>
<p>About the routing feature, we can consider as a more detailed and customized blue green deployment , this specific case it's really useful when we have to deploy new features in production and <em>canary</em> deployment is not enough to cover the business measurement we need.</p>
<p>This feature could be used to keep a specific affinity within the microservices and this is the real feature that some of you can consider, imagine a strict dependencies between application an cache (as usual)<br>So the application <em>Pippo</em> is using the cache <em>Paperino</em></p>
<p>Pippo is a namespace composed by 10 pods<br>Paperino is a cache composed by 6 pods</p>
<p>Imagine that we have the cache as a replication/sharded and we have 2 availability zones</p>
<p>With service mesh we can use labels to say to Pippo to use the cache Paperino only in the availability zone where the call start from Pippo av, this will reduce dramatically the roundtrip and the answer</p>
<p>I played a bit with service mesh in order to answer some questions,<br>however related to firewall rules the right answer is Cilium :-)</p>
<p>With this, I'd like to say that service mash give you a great value only<br>if your infrastructure is able to embrace it and only if you know what you are doing with this infrastructure.</p>

<p>Well , why we are talking about apache httpd in kubernetes ?<br>We have ingress resources , we have ambassador and we are using microservices...<br>True but internet was not built yesterday and for some reasons out of my knowledge ,<br>people are ostinated to manage rewrite rules in apache instead to use a dedicated router application (react, zuul .. database!?!?! etc etc)<br>However sometimes we have to balance between the academic vision and the reality.</p>

<p>Talking about apache https , nginx , haproxy ... i'm referring to the idea behind manage a complex website.<br>A website could be composed my hundreds of microservices but the domain it's usually one<br><a href="http://www.example.com/" rel="nofollow">www.example.com</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.example.com/" rel="nofollow">www.example.com</a> has the root path /<br>/it/ managed by cms<br>/it/offerte managed by cms<br>/uk/ managed by cms<br>/uk/offers managed by cms<br>/../ whatever<br>/it/clienti/ managed by customer-app<br>/uk/customers/ managed by customers-app<br>/../somethingelse<br>/secure/ managey by payment-app<br>...<br>omg path clash ... so we need to exclude in apache /uk/customers/ from cms proxypass but<br>meantime enable a dedicated proxy pass to a specific application endpoint.<br>and we are mannually manage all language , all applications with static configurations...<br>and if tomorrow we will open APAC ... what we have to do ?<br>and if we need to cover a former third parti company and acquire his seo ranking we should create<br>thousands of redirects ? and how we can can validate avoiding loops ?</p>
<p>A better design start giving the right responsability , that could be managed using a business layer<br>that we can call "front controller" where we can apply all rules.</p>
<p>In terms of responsability all applaction behind this layer should be working by selfcontained logic<br>example... if i have a seo application this should be working without this layer , removing direct dependency<br>same concept for cms application , customers application and so on.<br>So what this layer will do ?</p>
<p>A front controller should be the owner of root path of our websites "/"<br>Should be also responsible to handle all the others paths after the root ones.</p>
<p>Main duties:</p>
<ul>
<li>handle all requests and manage the backend application with business logic</li>
<li>provide dynamic path based on business rules (language + brand + something else)</li>
<li>provide the AB test logic</li>
<li>provide a validation logic</li>
<li>expose a company backoffice to trim the website layout</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>Having a global websites spread with multiple countris with differents domains/brands and languages we can immagine</p>

<p>Where the microservice/application CMS is responsible to hangle all domains and all languages and the<br>front controller take the ownership to match brand plus .tld (or paths "/fr/")<br>in order to dinamically generate the right url with canonical pages.</p>
<p>Many and many others assumptions can be covered by this componet, however we have to stay grounded<br>and check how we can manage an apache responsible to redirects proxypass an rewrite rules.</p>

<p>Even if we are working in a dynamic environment it's no rare to have the traditional layers</p>
<p>DMZ --&gt; layer 1<br>Application --&gt; layer 2<br>Database --&gt;layer 3</p>
<p>In this picture apache httpd should usually placed on layer 1 ,<br>but consider apache not for the common web server but like a "product" ,<br>something that could be managed not by SRE , but Product Engeneer.<br>A product that own a dedicated business, like seo, sem , vanity urls etc etc.</p>
<p>Having those considerations, we can "downgrade" apache httpd in layer 2 like any application<br>and honor the DMZ (if needed ?!?!) on top by ingress/haproxy/bigf5 (where maybe we can terminate the TLS).</p>

<p>The code in this project is designet to manage apache configuration by configmap,<br>however some websites are really complex and there are some limits implication with ectd max object size.</p>
<p>In this scenario it's higly raccomended to deploy the release with a standard pipeline with compiled<br>container on the source.</p>
